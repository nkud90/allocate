# allocate
Capital management project

### General terms
Allocate project allows users to seamlessly outsource capital allocation management to a combination of professional asset managers and AI.
 
The project's **goal** is to consistently outperform common benchmarks (S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes, Bitcoin price). 

The project serves society in several ways:

1. It contributes to the overall market efficiency by addressing market's extreme conditions of overheat or depression, actively reallocating capital between the core asset classes during the stages.
2. It allows users to gain exposure to multiple asset classes without the need to establish the appropriate infrastructure.
3. A user gets an investment instrument that is less volatile yet more efficient than a stand-alone asset class.

The project's mission should be considered accomplished in the following cases:
1. There are enough other reputable and well-established multi-asset investment vehicles which constantly outperform common benchmarks, as well as the project's performance. 
2. There is no more need in active capital allocation as the core assets are very efficient in terms of return to drawdowns ratio.

### Technical details
A token (BRC-20?) should be deployed with (?) quantity and mint limit of (?). 

A purchase of the token transfers bitcoins from a user's wallet to the Project's multi-sig cold wallet with geographically remote private keys. 
Project's asset managers allocate the received transfer to assets according to the current Project's portfolio composition.
The tokens are listed on the Project's web-page and other resources. 
The Project's traders act as market makers for the Project's tokens: there are always a bid and ask limit orders available for a user.
Prices of the orders are set to Â±(n)% from the Project's net assets value (NAV), setting the internal incentive for the Project to act as a token's buyer of last resort.
